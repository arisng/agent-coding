Here are conventions for generating markdown content:

- Converting emphasized text used as headings (e.g., `**1. Use Case...**`) to proper markdown headings (e.g., `##### 1. Use Case...`).
- Standardizing unordered list markers to `-` (dash).
- Ensuring correct spacing after list markers (one space).
- Adjusting indentation for nested lists to be consistent (typically 2 spaces for each level of nesting under the parent).
- Adding blank lines around list structures where appropriate.
- Escaping single quotes/apostrophes (e.g., `Node A's` to `Node A\'s`) for the tool call.
- all code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks (```) and specifying the language for syntax highlighting.
- using single space after the list marker.
