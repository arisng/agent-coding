# ASP.NET Core General Coding Standards

## Coding Style

- use file scoped namespace
- use region directives to group related code
- use explicit type declarations instead of `var` when the type is not obvious

## Naming Conventions

- private field naming convention: `_fieldName`
- public property naming convention: `PropertyName`
