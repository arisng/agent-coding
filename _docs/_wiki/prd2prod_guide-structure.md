## 1. Content Structure for `_progress` Files

`_progress` files serve as a high-level index and priority guide for functionality and non-functionality scopes outlined in the corresponding `_prd` file. They provide an overview of development priorities and progress, with detailed tasks delegated to `task_` files.

**Visual Design Principles:**

- Use clear status indicators (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üî¥ ‚ö†Ô∏è üìã ‚è∏Ô∏è) for quick scanning
- Group items by status for easy identification of current work
- Include progress percentages and completion estimates
- Use consistent formatting for rapid information processing

### 1.1. Required Structure

1. **Title**
   - Format: `# Progress for <Feature/Project Name>`
   - Example: `# Progress for Azure Blob Storage Management`

2. **Current Focus Dashboard**
   - High-level statistics and current objective focus
   - Visual progress indicators and key metrics
   - Current work-in-progress (WIP) highlights
   - Flexible time period support (daily, weekly, or custom cycles)

3. **Status-Organized Sections**
   - Group by status (In Progress ‚Üí Blocked ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Ready to Start ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Deferred)
   - Include both functional and non-functional scopes within each status group
   - Use visual indicators for immediate recognition

4. **Current Focus Period**
   - What's actively being worked on right now
   - Immediate blockers and dependencies
   - Next priorities
   - Adaptable to any workflow cadence

5. **References**
   - Links to related documentation and PRD files

### 1.2. Enhanced Entry Format with Visual Indicators

Each scope entry should include:

- **Status Icon:** Visual indicator (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üî¥ ‚ö†Ô∏è üìã ‚è∏Ô∏è)
- **Scope Name:** Clear, descriptive name
- **ID:** Unique identifier (F001, N001, etc.)
- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low with visual emphasis
- **Progress:** Completion percentage and current status
- **Estimate:** Expected timeline or remaining effort
- **Description:** Brief scope description
- **Related Files:** Links to task and specification files

**Status Icons Legend:**

- ‚úÖ **Done:** Completed and verified
- ‚è≥ **In Progress:** Currently being worked on
- üî¥ **Blocked:** Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review:** Completed but under review
- üìã **Not Started:** Ready to begin
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Deferred:** Postponed for future consideration

**Priority Visual Indicators:**

- üî• **High Priority**
- üü° **Medium Priority**
- üîµ **Low Priority**

### 1.3. Template Reference

For a complete, ready-to-use template implementing these enhanced visual indicators and flexible time-period structure, see:

**[Progress Template](./prd2prod_template-progress.md)** - Copy-paste ready template with:

- Current Focus dashboard (adaptable to any time period)
- Status-organized sections with visual indicators
- Enhanced entry format with progress tracking
- Built-in legend and usage instructions
- Flexible workflow support (daily, weekly, or custom cycles)

The template demonstrates the visual scanning principles and provides placeholder content that can be quickly customized for any project or workflow methodology.

### 1.4. References Section Format

```markdown
## References
- [_prd.md](./_prd.md)
- [Related Documentation Link](./link-to-documentation.md)
```

## 2. Content Structure for `_prd` Files

# Issue: Login Timeout After 5 Minutes

## Summary
Users are being logged out automatically after 5 minutes of inactivity, which is too short for typical usage patterns.

## Description
The current session timeout is set to 5 minutes, causing frequent logouts during normal application use. Users report frustration with having to re-authenticate multiple times per session.

## Impact
- All active users
- Reduced user experience
- Increased support requests

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log into the application
2. Leave the application idle for 5 minutes
3. Try to perform any action
4. Observe automatic logout

## Expected Behavior
Session should remain active for at least 30 minutes of inactivity for standard users.

## Actual Behavior
Session expires after exactly 5 minutes of inactivity.

## Environment
- Production environment
- All user types affected
- Occurring since deployment v2.1.0

## Proposed Solution
1. Increase default session timeout to 30 minutes
2. Add configurable timeout settings
3. Implement "remember me" option for extended sessions

## Status
Identified - pending task creation

## Related Files
- [task_F001_user-auth.md](./task_F001_user-auth.md)
- [_progress.md](./_progress.md)
```

## 6. Content Structure for `log_` Files

Daily log files provide quick progress snapshots with minimal cognitive overhead:

### 6.1. Required Structure

1. **Title:** `# Log [Date]`
2. **Done:** Completed work (bullet points)
3. **Working:** Current focus areas with status
4. **Blocked:** Impediments requiring action
5. **Next:** Tomorrow's priorities
6. **Notes:** Key decisions, discoveries, or observations

### 6.2. Example Log Structure

```markdown
# Log 2025-06-26

## Done
- Implemented login endpoint with JWT tokens
- Fixed session timeout (now 30 minutes)
- Updated auth unit tests

## Working
- Password reset flow (60% - waiting on email service)
- Session middleware integration (started today)

## Blocked
- Email config pending DevOps
- DB migration needs approval

## Next
- Complete logout endpoint
- Code review with team
- Start rate limiting research

## Notes
- Decision: JWT over server sessions for scalability
- Found good JWT library: [link]
- Password policy: 8+ chars, mixed case, numbers
```

## 7. Recommended Status Values

To ensure consistency and clarity across all files, use these standardized status values:

### 7.1. Primary Status Values

- **Not Started:** Work has not begun on this scope or task
- **In Progress:** Work is actively being done
- **Blocked:** Progress is halted due to a dependency, issue, or external factor
- **Review:** Work is complete and under review (e.g., code review, QA)
- **Done:** Work is fully completed and accepted
- **Deferred:** Work is intentionally postponed for future consideration

### 7.2. Extended Status Values (Optional)

- **Planning:** Requirements gathering and planning phase
- **Design:** Design and architecture phase
- **Development:** Active coding/implementation
- **Testing:** Testing and quality assurance
- **Deployment:** Deployment and production setup
- **Monitoring:** Post-deployment monitoring and observation

### 7.3. Status Usage Guidelines

- **Be Consistent:** Use the same status values across all files
- **Be Current:** Update status regularly as work progresses
- **Be Clear:** Status should immediately indicate current state
- **Be Specific:** Use extended values when more granularity is helpful
