# Content Structure for `devspec_` Files

`devspec_` files provide detailed technical specifications for a particular group of tasks derived from a `feat_` file. The goal is to ensure a developer has all necessary information to implement the described functionality.

1. **Title:**
    - The file should start with a title in the format `# Dev Spec: <Feature Name> (<Feature ID>) - <Task Group Name>`.
    - Example: `# Dev Spec: File Upload (F002) - Chunked Upload Handler`

2. **References & Links:**
    - **Related `feat_` file:** Link to the parent `feat_<ID>_<name>.md` file.
    - **Related `_tasks` file:** Link to the main `_tasks` file.
    - **Related `_prd` file:** Link to the Product Requirements Document.
    - **Relevant Designs/Mocks:** Links to UI/UX designs, API contracts (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI specs), or other visual aids.
    - Example:

        ```markdown
        - **Parent Feature:** [feat_file-upload.md](./feat_file-upload.md)
        - **Tasks Overview:** [_tasks.md](./_tasks.md)
        - **PRD:** [_prd.md](./_prd.md)
        - **API Contract:** [swagger.json](../api-specs/swagger.json)
        ```

3. **Overview:**
    - A brief summary of the functionality or component to be developed.
    - Describe its purpose and how it fits into the larger feature or system.

4. **Scope of Work:**
    - Clearly list the specific tasks covered by this dev spec. This should be a subset or a detailed breakdown of tasks from the `feat_` file.
    - Use a checklist format.
    - Example:

        ```markdown
        - [ ] Implement API endpoint for initiating chunked upload.
        - [ ] Develop logic for handling individual file chunks.
        - [ ] Implement mechanism for reassembling chunks.
        - [ ] Add validation for file type and size per chunk.
        - [ ] Write unit tests for the chunk handling logic.
        ```

5. **Technical Details & Requirements:**
    - **Data Structures/Models:** Define any new or modified data models, including fields, types, and validation rules.
    - **API Endpoints (if applicable):**
        - HTTP Method and Path
        - Request Headers
        - Request Body (with example)
        - Success Response (status code, body with example)
        - Error Responses (status codes, body with example)
    - **Algorithm/Logic Flow:** For complex processes, describe the step-by-step logic. Flowcharts or pseudocode can be embedded or linked.
    - **Database Changes (if applicable):** Schema modifications, new tables, stored procedures, etc.
    - **External Service Interactions:** Details of any calls to other microservices, third-party APIs, including authentication, request/response formats.
    - **Error Handling:** Specific error conditions to handle and how they should be reported or logged.
    - **Security Considerations:** Authentication, authorization, input validation, data protection, etc.
    - **Performance Requirements:** Expected response times, throughput, resource utilization, etc.
    - **Logging Requirements:** Key events or data points that need to be logged.

6. **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - A list of conditions that must be met for the implementation to be considered complete and correct.
    - These should be testable.
    - Example:

        ```markdown
        - Chunked upload successfully processes files up to 1GB.
        - API returns `201 Created` upon successful reassembly.
        - API returns `400 Bad Request` if chunk size exceeds the limit.
        - All uploaded chunks are deleted after successful reassembly.
        - Errors during chunk processing are logged with appropriate details.
        ```

7. **Out of Scope (Optional):**
    - Clearly list any related functionalities or tasks that are intentionally not covered by this dev spec to avoid ambiguity.

8. **Open Questions/Decisions Needed (Optional):**
    - A section to list any unresolved questions or decisions that need to be addressed before or during development.

By following this structure, `devspec_` files will provide clear, actionable guidance for developers.

## Rationale

- **Sorting:** Prefixes like `_` ensure that core documents appear at the top of file listings.
- **Consistency:** Ensures all team members follow a uniform naming strategy.
- **Readability:** Kebab-case and lowercase are easy to read.
- **Discoverability:** Prefixes allow for quick identification of file types and easier sorting/filtering.
- **URL-Friendly:** Kebab-case is generally URL-friendly if these documents are ever served via a web server or wiki.

This convention aims to keep the documentation organized and maintainable as the project evolves.
