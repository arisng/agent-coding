## Front Matter Syntax

Front matter in Markdown is a section at the beginning of a file (indented with `---`) that contains metadata. It allows you to add key-value pairs like `title`, `author`, `date`, or `tags`. For example:

```markdown
---
title: My Document
author: John Doe
date: 2025-05-10
---

This is the content of the document.
```

In the context of the cheat sheet, front matter is used to define headers (e.g., `applyTo`) and organize instructions by topic. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for customizing Markdown files in tools like GitHub Copilot.
