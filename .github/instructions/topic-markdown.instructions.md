Here are conventions for generating markdown content:

## General Conventions
- Do not try to fix linting errors in the markdown file.
- Escaping single quotes/apostrophes (e.g., `Node A's` to `Node A\'s`) for the tool call.

## Structural Elements

  **A. Headings**
  - Converting emphasized text used as headings (e.g., `**1. Use Case...**`) to proper markdown headings (e.g., `##### 1. Use Case...`).

  **B. Lists**
  - Standardizing unordered list markers to `-` (dash).
  - Spaces after list markers expected 1 space.
  - Adjusting indentation for nested lists to be consistent (typically 2 spaces for each level of nesting under the parent).

  **C. Code Blocks**
  - All code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks (```) and specifying the language for syntax highlighting.

## Formatting & Spacing
- Adding blank lines around list structures where appropriate.
- Adding blank lines around code blocks.
- Adding blank lines around headings.
- Adding blank lines around images.
